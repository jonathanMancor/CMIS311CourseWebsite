        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 1 of the book discusses delivering high customer satisfaction
          through effective service desk operations and trends shaping the
          technical support field. It underscores the critical role of the
          service desk as the primary contact point in technical support, where
          customer interactions significantly influence their overall perception
          of the company and its products. The chapter emphasizes the importance
          of implementing all available assets such as people, processes, technology, and information
          to ensure service desk success.
        </p>
        <p>
          It highlights the growing demand for
          technical support driven by computing technologies and the resulting
          career opportunities in customer service and technical support due to
          a shortage of IT professionals. It also touches on
          the importance of managing customer expectations with a proactive
          'can do' approach and highlights the evolving nature of the support
          industry, which offers significant opportunities for individuals with
          business, technical, soft, and self-management skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, it outlines various
          trends affecting the service desk industry, such as multigenerational
          and multichannel support, continuous service availability, and the overall
          professionalization of service desk roles.
