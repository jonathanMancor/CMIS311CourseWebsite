        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          Chapter 6, "Solving and Preventing Incidents and Problems," is about the
          structured processes and problem-solving techniques within the role of service
          desk analysts to manage and resolve incidents effectively. It emphasizes
          the importance of the incident management process, which aims to
          preserve service and minimize the impact on company systems. This process
          is used for handling incidents consistently and efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chapter talks about the role of the incident owner, who takes
          responsibility for resolving incidents within a promised timeframe and
          communicating status updates to customers and management. The concept
          of ownership is used to maintaining focus on customer needs and ensuring
          transparency when delays occur, preventing incidents from being overlooked
          and reducing customer dissatisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Effective problem-solving involves gathering data, generating information,
          and diagnosing the issue before implementing a solution. Effective techniques
          for identifying the underlying problems are asking leading questions,
          replicating the customer's issue, and using diagnostic tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, the chapter covers the problem management process, which
          focuses on preventing future incidents by identifying root causes. This
          involves detailed recording of incident data, which is essential for
          accurate reporting and trend analysis. Techniques like brainstorming,
          the Five Whys, cause and effect analysis, Pareto analysis, and Kepner-Tregoe
          analysis are used to thoroughly investigate and diagnose problems. The
          effectiveness of problem management is dependant on the accuracy of the data
          provided by service desk analysts.
